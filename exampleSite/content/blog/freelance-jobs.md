## FREELANCING

##### TIps {.h-warn}

Visual paragraph headings
On moderately sized pages, we usually don’t want to apply the full heading hierarchy because too much structure is as confusing as too little. We may like to skip one or two levels and use paragraph headings in normal sections for example.
However, this would violate official HTML guidelines and mess up the table of contents (TOC). Heading tags always need to descend strictly also because screen readers and other automatic interpreters get confused otherwise.
To abide by this rule, we can skip headings only visually. Any heading does look like a paragraph heading with the attribute {.h-p} or {.h-p-s} for a small paragraph heading.
Highlighted headings
To emphasize especially important text segments, we can start them with a highlighted heading. This is a more subtle option than annotation boxes.
To mark a section about some danger, warning, information, or success, we apply the attributes {.h-danger}, {.h-warn}, {.h-info}, or {.h-success}.
A warning paragraph for example starts with a heading like this:
##### Warning Paragraph {.h-warn}
  
Before the last word or between tightly related words. To introduce a manual break of our own choosing we can put the replacement code {‍/} between two words without any spacing character like this:
### Nice long heading with a complicated topic{‍/}stretching over more than one line
and we get:
